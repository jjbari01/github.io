    <li>With the pressure for success after the IPO, Webvan, a Louis Borders of Borders Books venture, is taxed with the pressure to expand into brick and mortar regional grocery chains or push forward with the distribution centers expanding additional product lines recoginzing the Internet Business Model.  This strategic development crossroads leaves Webvan in a conundrum to navigate unknown territory with newer technology and dare to move over the traditional grocery stores ensconced in bounded rationality. <br/>

    <li>In eight years, Symantec grew from 30 employees to 316 over 3 states with revenues garnering $50 million and a share price of $1.05 per share by 1989. What should Symantec do to remedy increased volume and redundancy of sales, finance, and human resources. Five product groups each containing their own product development, marketing, quality assurance, support and management with only finance, HR and sales being centralized. Their current IT solution is inadequate for the growth phase of Symantec. Two information systems one to provide structure for accounting, manufacturing schedules and inventory control coupled with a network system to allow for companywide email.<br/>

    <li>This is an ethical dilemma between getting what was requested and paid by any means necessary when given the opportunity or potentially losing the overall investment and be left without a final product.Agrico’s responsibility is to its stakeholders in the interest of earning a profit.  According to Morgan’s “interests”, there are predispositions embracing goals, values, desires, expectations, and inclinations.  Agrico entered into the contract with their current and future “interests” in mind.  Burdelle’s interest standing at the Ms. Seymour’s computer at a virtual impasse determining the weighted interests of his company, the responsibility to the shareholders, the tasks of his position against his personal moral.<br/>

    <li>The quandary is how to affect change throughout the now divisional organization through what has shown to be a valuable IT asset affecting every department of the Los Angeles division of Connor Metals to the remaining divisions of Connor Metals.  There has been pushback from the managers at the other 3 locations in San Jose, Dallas, and Portland for this forward moving transformation as told by one of the managers;, […]whether the system would really work in the smaller divisions”. The new Connor Software had shown dramatic improvements in the Los Angeles location as stated by Cash noting “ a number of jobs increased by 20 percent” and “repeat defective jobs reduced from 14% to 4%” within a year. Not only did they see improvement from the shop but there was an improvement from their bottlenecked backlogs from 10% to less than 1% all while “improving sales 28%  for an annual level of $10 Million”.<br/>

    <li>Appex Corporation is currently trying to leverage the heart of their organization of informal and fluid coupled with cooperation and an “all hands on deck” attitude and survive with the necessity of a functional classic organizational structure. Appex Corporation offered two products to the market, intercarrier services (ICS) and cellular management information systems (IS).The ICS product provided services to manage the information for carriers for “roaming” charges when a cellular phone was out network coupled with the key element the Positive Roamer Verification, providing 60% of the total revenue. The secondary business was IS and consisted of two products Appex Cellular Management Information Systems (MCIS) for large companies and Appex Billing Service (ABS) for small to medium sized companies. The MCIS and ABS software charged a fixed fee and represented 40% of the total revenue. Appex had grown exponentially over the course of 3 years with total revenues quadrupling from $1 million in 1987 to $16.6 million in 1990. Right along with revenue growth, the Appex family grew from a team of 26 to a medium to large size company of 103 within one year.<br/>

    <li>After transportation deregulated in 1980, Burlington Northern (BN) had a vision to implement avionic equipment into trains to differentiate themselves on what is now an open market.  Since, this product didn’t exist, BN partnered with Rockwell Automation to create a whole new communication and central data system, Advanced Railroad Electronics System (ARES), to expedite decision for smoother transitions and potential future analysis. Through several executive leadership change overs, critical analysis of the potential ROI after they were already heavily invested the ARES system dies and BN sold. Had BN followed through with the implementation of ARES, would it have saved their visionary project and potentially their company allowing them to be competitive within the railroad industry?<br/>
